Its foundation on the bank of river Porsuk by the Phrygians dates back to the 1st millennium BC. The historical city holds out Phrygian relics and sculptures through its museums. </p></section>
   <section><p>The most famous museum in Eskisehir is the Ottoman House museum, which is the storehouse of 19th century domestic architecture of Turkey`s local ethnographical items. It was founded in the 1st millennium BC by the Phrygians. Hittites assembled a great government centralized in Eskişehir B.C.14. Century. The king of Phrygians declared his kingdom which lasted for 600 years in B.C.12. During 600 years following Phrygian King, the city was calledGordion. Great Alexander and his army, passing from Gordion 2300 years ago, conquered Gordion. But affter the death of Great Alexander, city of Gordion had witnessed great wars because of its location. Many commanders who wanted to control Anatolia tried to conquer Gordion city. First Galats and then the Romans captured the region at the end of the year B.C. 189. In the 4th century AD, the city was moved about 10km northeast, from Karacahisar to Şehirhöyük. When it was controlled by the Roman Empire, Constantine the Great introduced the religion Christianity to this region as well as the other parts of Anatolia. Romans, restored Gordion city, and the city was living its glorious days by then. When the Seljuks conquered the place, they called it Sultanönü in 1074. But with the foundation of the Ottoman Empire, it was called Eskişehir for the first time. During the Turkish War of Independence (1919-1922), it was a very important location of strategy. After this war, modern-day Eskişehir was rebuilt with a number of historic buildings remain.The most famous museum in Eskisehir is the Ottoman House museum, which is the storehouse of 19th century domestic architecture of Turkey`s local ethnographical items.
